# Blackbuck Detection from Drone Footage using YOLOv8
## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting male and female blackbucks in drone-captured videos using the YOLOv8 object detection framework. The primary motivation is to automate wildlife monitoring and support ecological research by providing accurate detection of blackbucks in challenging aerial footage.

## üìä Dataset

Source: Drone videos of blackbuck habitats

Total videos: 9 (7 for training, 2 for testing)

Classes:

male_blackbuck

female_blackbuck

Format: Images extracted from drone footage, annotated in YOLO format

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

Model: Ultralytics YOLOv8

Input resolutions tested: 640p, 1040p, 1240p

Training: Transfer learning using pretrained YOLOv8 weights

Metrics evaluated:

Validation mAP (mAP50-95)

Test confidence and F1-score

## üìà Results
Resolution Impact on F1-Score
Resolution	F1-Score
640p	0.51
1040p	0.79
1240p	0.82

Key insight: Higher resolutions significantly improve detection accuracy because blackbucks appear small in drone footage.

Going from 640p ‚Üí 1040p yields a large improvement (+0.28 in F1).

Going from 1040p ‚Üí 1240p shows diminishing returns (+0.03).

Validation vs Test Accuracy

Validation mAP50-95: 0.089 (8.9%)

Test Mean Confidence: 0.266 (26.6%)

This shows that while the model is somewhat confident in predictions, actual localization accuracy (mAP) is still low, likely due to dataset size and complexity.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Drawbacks

Small dataset ‚Äì Only 9 videos, which limits generalization.

Low validation mAP ‚Äì Suggests underfitting or need for more diverse training data.

Resolution trade-off ‚Äì

Low resolutions (e.g., 640p) fail to capture fine features (horns, contours).

High resolutions (1240p) improve accuracy but at the cost of higher GPU memory and inference time.

Sweet spot: ~1040p, balancing accuracy and compute.
